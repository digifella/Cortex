   Setup Instructions:
   1. Install Docker Desktop from https://docker.com
   2. Extract this ZIP file
   3. Open terminal/command prompt in the 'docker' folder
   4. Run: run-cortex.sh (Linux/Mac) or run-cortex.bat (Windows)
   5. Wait 5-10 minutes for first-time setup
   6. Open http://localhost:8501
   
   That's it!
   ```

**Option B: Git Repository (For developers)**
```bash
git clone your-repo-url
cd cortex-suite/docker
./run-cortex.sh  # or run-cortex.bat on Windows
```
