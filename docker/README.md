## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- 10GB free disk space
- Internet connection for initial setup

## üîê IMPORTANT: Environment Setup (Required)

**BEFORE FIRST RUN**: You must create your environment configuration:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys (optional for local-only usage)
nano .env  # or use any text editor
```

### Required for Cloud AI Features (Optional):
If you want to use cloud AI providers for research (instead of local models only):

```bash
# Add your API keys to .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_key_here
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_actual_youtube_key_here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY NOTE**: 
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- The `.env` file contains your API keys and should remain private
- For local-only usage, you can use the default ollama settings

## What Gets Created Fresh

Every installation creates a completely fresh environment:
- ‚úÖ New ChromaDB vector database
- ‚úÖ New knowledge graph
- ‚úÖ Empty working collections
- ‚úÖ Fresh configuration files
- üö´ No pre-existing user data

## Common Commands

```bash
# Stop Cortex Suite
docker stop cortex-suite

# Start Cortex Suite  
docker start cortex-suite

# View logs
docker logs cortex-suite -f

# Remove completely (to reinstall)
docker stop cortex-suite && docker rm cortex-suite
```

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails with "Access denied" on Windows:**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Try: `docker system prune -f` then retry

**Cannot access localhost:8501:**
- Interface should be available within 10 seconds
- Check setup progress page for real-time status
- Check `docker logs cortex-suite` for startup progress

**Out of space errors:**
- Ensure 10GB+ free disk space
- Run: `docker system prune -f` to clean up

## Support

For issues or questions, check the logs with `docker logs cortex-suite -f` for detailed error messages.
