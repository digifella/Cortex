## v4.7.0 - 2025-09-02

### Search Stability & Docker Parity (Patch Addendum)

This patch delivers end-to-end Docker parity for the Streamlit UI and fixes external-path issues for Chroma and collections when running inside containers. It also restores Proposal Copilot and auxiliary pages in Docker-only distributions via targeted shims.

### ‚ú® New (Docker-only) Shims
- Added minimal modules under `docker/cortex_engine/` so docker distributions can run without the full engine:
  - `session_state`, `batch_manager`, `document_type_manager`
  - `instruction_parser` (iter_block_items, CortexInstruction, parse_template_for_instructions)
  - `task_engine` (refine, generate/retrieve from KB, assemble document)
  - `proposal_manager` (persist proposals under AI_DATABASE_PATH)
  - `graph_manager` (EnhancedGraphManager), `entity_extractor`
  - `document_summarizer`, `knowledge_synthesizer`, `synthesise`
  - `visual_search`, `help_system`, `setup_manager`, `backup_manager`, `sync_backup_manager`
  - `utils` additions: `process_drag_drop_path`, `process_multiple_drag_drop_paths`

### üöÄ Improvements
- Docker-aware path resolution: consistently maps Windows paths to container mounts, preferring `AI_DATABASE_PATH`.
- Collections and staging stored next to the external DB path (not the repo) in both host and Docker.
- Knowledge Ingest, Collection Management, and Knowledge Search updated to resolve container-visible paths.
- Batch state persisted under `knowledge_hub_db/batch_state.json` in Docker shim.
- Proposal Copilot restored in Docker with instruction parsing, basic generation/refinement, and doc assembly.
- Visual Analysis page now resolves drag/drop paths via centralized utils.

### üêõ Fixes
- Resolved Chroma/collections not writing to external DB path when running inside Docker.
- Eliminated ModuleNotFoundError across Docker pages by adding targeted shims.
- Fixed local NameError in Knowledge Search (path conversion import).

### üß© Installer
- Updated `docker/run-cortex.*` batch installers to show `v4.7.0` and current release name.
