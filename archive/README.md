## Old Search Pages (August 27, 2025)

### Archived Files:
- `old_search_pages/3_Knowledge_Search_OLD.py` - Original search page (v21.3.0) before major refactoring
- `old_search_pages/3_Knowledge_Search_OLD_docker.py` - Docker version of the above
- `old_search_pages/alternative_search.py` - Alternative search implementation for testing
- `old_search_pages/alternative_search_docker.py` - Docker version of the above

### Why Archived:
- **Knowledge Search OLD**: Contained outdated logic with ChromaDB where clause issues
- **Alternative Search**: Was a testing/debugging tool no longer needed
- **Codebase cleanup**: These files were creating confusion and maintenance overhead

### Current Implementation:
The active search functionality is now consolidated in:
- `pages/3_Knowledge_Search.py` (v22.4.3) - Universal version with Docker compatibility
- `docker/pages/3_Knowledge_Search.py` (v22.4.3) - Identical to main version

### Key Improvements in Current Version:
- ✅ Multi-strategy search for complex queries ("strategy and transformation")
- ✅ Boolean logic for metadata filters (AND/OR operators)
- ✅ Collection management with bulk actions
- ✅ Docker environment compatibility and conflict resolution
- ✅ Unified codebase (main and Docker versions identical)

### Historical Context:
These files represent the evolution of the search functionality from basic vector search to the current sophisticated multi-strategy approach with full boolean logic and Docker compatibility.
