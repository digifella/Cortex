# Cortex Suite - Security Sweep & Refactoring Progress

## Project Goals
- **Security Hardening**: Comprehensive security audit and vulnerability remediation
- **Modularity Enhancement**: Improve code organization and reduce coupling  
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Performance improvements and resource optimization

## Work Sessions

### Session 1 - Initial Security Sweep & Refactor Planning
**Date**: 2025-08-08
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

#### Completed Tasks
- âœ… Created work progress tracking system
- âœ… Reviewed existing architecture and documentation
- âœ… **MAJOR**: Completed comprehensive security audit
- âœ… Analyzed codebase structure for security vulnerabilities
- âœ… Reviewed file handling and input validation
- âœ… Checked for hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposure

#### Current Tasks - SECURITY FIXES (Priority Order)
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Fix unsafe pickle deserialization vulnerability
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Fix path traversal vulnerabilities  
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Fix subprocess command injection
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Fix authentication bypass in API
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Implement proper input sanitization
- ðŸ”„ Identifying areas needing modularity improvements

#### Security Vulnerabilities Found

**ðŸ”´ CRITICAL Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Unsafe Pickle Deserialization** - `cortex_engine/graph_manager.py:17`
   - Risk: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
   - Impact: Attackers can execute arbitrary code via malicious pickle files
   
**ðŸ”´ HIGH Vulnerabilities:**
2. **Path Traversal** - Multiple files, weak validation in `cortex_engine/utils/path_utils.py:245`
   - Risk: Unauthorized file system access
   - Impact: Can read/write files outside intended directories

3. **Subprocess Command Injection** - `pages/2_Knowledge_Ingest.py:544`
   - Risk: Command execution with user input
   - Impact: Shell command injection via crafted file paths

4. **Insecure File Upload** - `api/main.py:399`
   - Risk: Malicious file upload
   - Impact: No file type/size validation, potential server compromise

**ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM Vulnerabilities:**
5. **Authentication Bypass** - `api/main.py:186-192`
   - Risk: All API requests accepted regardless of token
   - Impact: Unauthorized API access

6. **Information Disclosure in Logs** - Multiple locations
   - Risk: API tokens and sensitive data logged
   - Impact: Credential exposure

#### Security Focus Areas Identified
- âœ… File upload and processing (PDF, images, documents) - **VULNERABILITIES FOUND**
- âœ… Environment variable and API key handling - **SOME ISSUES FOUND**  
- âœ… Database path validation and access controls - **MAJOR ISSUES FOUND**
- âœ… User input sanitization in Streamlit components - **INSUFFICIENT**
- âœ… Logging sensitive information prevention - **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

#### Refactoring Opportunities
- Common utility extraction (already started with `cortex_engine/utils/`)
- Error handling standardization
- Configuration management consolidation
- Database connection patterns
- Logging standardization (in progress)
- **NEW**: Security utilities module needed for input sanitization

## Architecture Notes
- Current modular structure with `cortex_engine/` backend and `pages/` frontend
- Utilities centralization already begun in `cortex_engine/utils/`
- Exception hierarchy implemented in `cortex_engine/exceptions.py`
- Standardized logging framework in place

## Security Considerations
- WSL2 environment with cross-platform path handling
- Multiple LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama) requiring secure API key management
- File system access for document ingestion and knowledge base storage
- Vector database and graph database persistence
