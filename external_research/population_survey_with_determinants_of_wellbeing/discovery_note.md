# Discovery Note: Population Survey with Determinants of Wellbeing

## 1. Sociocultural determinants of wellbeing
The analysis reveals that socio-cultural factors play a significant role in determining the health outcomes, particularly maternal health, in various contexts such as Nigeria [1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75f1c3410fa8a2e9bd82d000f3b0308e613bbed7). These factors include gender, religion, traditional belief systems, education, marital status, socioeconomic status, and societal construction of gender.

## 2. Maternal health outcomes and sociocultural factors
A review on maternal health outcomes in Nigeria uncovers that various social and cultural aspects have a significant impact on maternal health [1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75f1c3410fa8a2e9bd82d000f3b0308e613bbed7). Factors such as age, religion, traditional belief systems, education, marital status, socioeconomic status, and societal construction of gender were identified as major determinants.

## 3. Young people’s perspectives on socio-ecological determinants of wellbeing
A qualitative exploration among young people from New Zealand reveals that their mental health is affected by multiple factors within the social environment, including systemic issues and an evolving digital landscape [2](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba5358262141f2c1b3b4ebd4b8c4f5414edc845d). The study identified four themes impacting wellbeing: The world we live in, the pressures we experience, the connections we need, and finding our path.

## 4. Psychometric equivalence of the Personal Wellbeing Index
There is no specific information available regarding the psychometric equivalence of the Personal Wellbeing Index for normally functioning and homeostatically defeated Australian adults [3](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e04949754922d756c921e8ced568af3503a2c6f6).

## 5. Urban populations and infrastructure needs
Research suggests that urban populations are linked to increased infrastructure needs, as evident in the United States [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGMnGPIY34). It is essential to invest in infrastructure to accommodate growing urban populations to ensure their wellbeing and quality of life.

## Open Questions
- What are specific interventions proposed for addressing the identified sociocultural determinants of maternal health outcomes in Nigeria [1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75f1c3410fa8a2e9bd82d000f3b0308e613bbed7)?
- How does the digital landscape interact with social determinants of wellbeing among young people, and what are potential interventions to address declining youth mental health [2](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba5358262141f2c1b3b4ebd4b8c4f5414edc845d)?
- What are the implications of urban population growth on infrastructure needs, and how can we ensure that these needs are met to promote wellbeing [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGMnGPIY34)?
- How does the Personal Wellbeing Index perform in different cultural contexts, and what is its potential for use in population surveys across various countries [3](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e04949754922d756c921e8ced568af3503a2c6f6)?
